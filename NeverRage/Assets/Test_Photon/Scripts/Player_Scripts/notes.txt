//About the Scripts (important things to remind me of)

-VthirdPersonMotor, 
has reference to animator, but doesn't control the animator...it does physics
This is serve as Library for the CharacterController
this is 1st protocall script, and its private, the only link between it and the 
public scripts is the public virtual handles in the CharacterController.
What ever is called in the CharacterController, is also called in this script.
Changing this script directly influences the CharacterController and its referencers.

vThirdPersonAnimator
-Second Protocal, like the PersonController script...it also reference the 
vThirdPersonMotor...but it does so, directly, and make animation possible 
after checking in with the PersonMotor to see if the player
should be moving.


vThirdPersonController
-Third protocal, gets it references from the Motor, through the PersonAnimator script
and this is shared to other public scripts that reference it to verify
mobility on the player, and the motor/engine that makes the motion happens, with
physices and everything.

vThirdPersonInput
-Fourth Protocal, get its check from the vThirdPersonController...to see if everything
is setup, and ready for player input.
Collect All of this and Make it Available through the Player's Input
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-PlayerManager is from the pun tutorial

-vThirdPersonInput is the PlayerAnimatorManager because it control the player wasd 
and space movement. It has access to the cc/characterControllerScript/vthirdpersonController
so it can get permision from the player states (is he in the air, is he grounded, 
can he move, etc)

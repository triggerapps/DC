Trying to  Keep Track of the Player 
So I dont Instaite more than one
So, I also know which one own a controller and which one needs 1

In Manager
and Playerinput

-I am about to use the other youtube tutorial

---I will make player manager and try to control the camera from there
I will most likely remove the controlls from the player input script

-----I can name this InputController, and follow the youtube tutorial or 
---stick with player manager and try to photon way

The photon way: I will take the cameWork method, by calling the camera controller 
methods from in PlayerManager instead of Input...then I will set the instance to 
PlayerManager, and then check that instance on GameManager

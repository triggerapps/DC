ReadMe:

The the ThirdPerson Input is the actual controller
It controlls the Camera,
It also controlls the Controller,

If you screw up, download a reset copy of the script from the asset store.

To really make this work, 
I will work on syncing the Camera
Then Focus on the movement and animation using the Input Controller as Player Manager 
And Animation Manager.

------------------------------------------
Do the tutorial from 1-5
Then on tutorial 7

put the PlayerAnimatorManager Update() in the tpInput Update()
and hand the CamWork, also go into the camwork and Adjust the start function in there.


If this dont work...make your controller from scratch or just watch someone else video
or keep trying.


This game's gonna get made
